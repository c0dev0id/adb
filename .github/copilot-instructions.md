# Instructions

This is a port for OpenBSD. Stick to the following rules:
  - Surgical, minimal changes only.
  - Do not change the overall structure of the code.
  - Keep changes in the adb/ directory if possible.
  - Don't rename anything without a very good reason.
  - Keep the code style consistent with the surrounding code.
  - Avoid introducing new dependencies.
  - Ensure the code compiles and runs correctly on OpenBSD.
  - Do not add any comments or explanations outside the code itself.
  - The diff to the initial code should be as small as possible.
